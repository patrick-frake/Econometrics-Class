n ## Econometrics Class
Tech used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodel

## Overview
One of my favorite classes at Rutgers is Econometrics. This class focuses on regression models. We had the choice to learn Stata or Python for our coding projects. Even though Stata's syntax is very simple and easier to learn than python, I chose python because of the versatility and the endless possibilities that python can be used for.
These projects are assignments based on what we are learning in class. These allow me to apply the theory and fundamentals of regression into an actual model. 

## Insights
I used pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodel in order to regress multiple variables, create scatter plots, and create lines of best fits. I even used what I learned to end a debate between my friend and I. That can be found under the repository named "Fun Project".
